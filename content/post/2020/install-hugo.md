How do you design your leadership development program? How do you evaluate and – most important – how do you redesign these programs?

Some of the key characteristics of a successful leadership development program are:

* a 

  **blended approach**

  : mentoring, workshops, group assignments, on-the-job assignments, reading, time to reflect, blending online and offline, on various locations
* build a 

  **platform of enduring learning**

   and leadership development; the larger part of learning takes place at work, while on the job; create a thriving environment for leaders to deploy what they’ve learned; it’s not a personal development program, but to lead others and drive a successful organizational development; design a customer and workforce-centric program, instead of a leadership-centric program; after all, it’s not (solely) about them but about their value to others and to the company
* deploy 

  **nowadays’ technology**

   that inspires, engages and provokes people’s thoughts and behaviours; AI, gamification, behavioural interventions, collaborative learning and collective intelligence can all be built-in to elevate and deepen learning from each other
* **design with reality as well as the future in mind**

  : collect vetted insights, by means of collective intelligence approaches such as CircleLytics Dialogue to learn about priorities, challenges and upcoming changes that require (new) leadership.

  , as research show, to become more effective and add more value; for this don’t limit yourself to insights from participants, yet also from employees.
